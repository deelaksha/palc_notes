## âœ¨ 1. Understanding Vim's Core Philosophy: Modes

The most crucial concept in Vim is its use of **modes**. Unlike regular text editors where typing always inserts characters, Vim separates the act of writing from the act of editing and commanding. This is Vim's superpower.

- **Normal Mode (The Command Center)**: This is the default mode. Every key press is a potential command. You use this mode to navigate, delete, copy, paste, and perform all other editing operations. You are a commander, and the keys are your orders. You'll spend most of your time in this mode. Press \`Esc\` from any other mode to return here.

- **Insert Mode (The Typewriter)**: This is for typing text. Once you enter Insert Mode, Vim behaves like a standard editor (like Notepad or Google Docs). You enter it from Normal mode using commands like \`i\`, \`a\`, \`o\`.

- **Visual Mode (The Highlighter)**: This mode is for selecting text. Once text is selected, you can run a command on it (like copy, delete, or transform). You enter it from Normal mode using \`v\` (character-wise), \`V\` (line-wise), or \`Ctrl-v\` (block-wise).

- **Command-Line Mode (The Power Tool)**: This mode is for running more complex "Ex" commands. When you press \`:\` in Normal mode, you jump to the command line at the bottom of the screen. This is where you save files (\`:w\`), quit (\`:q\`), perform search and replace (\`:%s/old/new/g\`), and manage editor settings.

The master workflow is: **Normal Mode** -> Enter another mode to perform a task -> Press **\`Esc\`** to return to **Normal Mode**.

    title: 'âœ¨ 2. Moving Around (Navigation)',
    content: `
### In-Depth Explanation

Navigation in Vim is designed to keep your hands on the home row, making you faster and more efficient. Instead of reaching for arrow keys or a mouse, you use letter keys. This feels slow at first but becomes lightning fast with practice.

**Mode**: Normal Mode

| Command | Breakdown | Detailed Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| \`h\` | (h) | **Move Left**: Moves the cursor one character to the left. It's on the home row, right under your index finger. |
| \`j\` | (j) | **Move Down**: Moves the cursor one line down. Think of the letter 'j' having a tail that goes down. |
| \`k\` | (k) | **Move Up**: Moves the cursor one line up. |
| \`l\` | (l) | **Move Right**: Moves the cursor one character to the right. |
| \`0\` | (zero) | **Jump to Beginning of Line**: Moves the cursor to the absolute first column of the current line. |
| \`^\` | (caret) | **Jump to First Non-Whitespace**: Moves to the first non-blank character on the line. More useful than \`0\` for indented code. |
| \`$\` | (dollar) | **Jump to End of Line**: The '$' often signifies the end in programming (e.g., regex), so it's a natural fit. |
| \`w\` | (word) | **Jump Forward by Word**: Moves to the beginning of the next word. Punctuation is treated as a word. |
| \`b\` | (back) | **Jump Backward by Word**: Moves to the beginning of the previous word. |
| \`gg\` | (go go) | **Go to Top of File**: Moves the cursor to the first line of the file. An easy way to remember is "Good Game" to restart. |
| \`G\` | (Go) | **Go to End of File**: Moves the cursor to the last line of the file. |
| \`Ctrl+d\` | (down) | **Scroll Down Half Page**: Moves the view down by half a screen. |
| \`Ctrl+u\` | (up) | **Scroll Up Half Page**: Moves the view up by half a screen. |

#### Real-World Example
Imagine you're editing a long configuration file. You need to get to the very last line to add a new setting. Instead of holding the down arrow for 30 seconds, you just press \`G\` in Normal mode. Instantly, you're at the bottom, ready to edit.

#### Tips & Common Pitfalls
- **Pitfall**: New users often stay in Insert mode and use the arrow keys. This is the biggest anti-pattern. Force yourself to use \`hjkl\`. It's the only way to build muscle memory.
- **Tip**: You can prefix movement commands with a number. \`10j\` moves you down 10 lines. \`5w\` jumps forward 5 words. This is called a **count** and is fundamental to Vim's efficiency.

#### Practice Exercises
1.  Open a multi-line file.
2.  Press \`G\` to go to the end, then \`gg\` to go to the top.
3.  Navigate to line 5 by typing \`5G\` or \`gg\` then \`4j\`.
4.  On a line of code, use \`0\` to go to the start, then \`^\` to jump past the indentation.
5.  Move forward 3 words at a time using \`3w\`.

    title: 'âœ¨ 3. Typing Text (Insert Mode)',
    content: `
### In-Depth Explanation

Insert mode is your "typing" mode. The key is not just *how* to enter it, but *where* you want to start typing. Vim provides multiple commands to enter Insert mode at the precise location you need, saving you extra navigation keystrokes.

**Mode**: Enter *from* Normal Mode.

| Command | Breakdown | Detailed Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| \`i\` | (insert) | **Insert Before Cursor**: Enters Insert mode and places the cursor *before* the character it's currently on. |
| \`I\` | (Insert) | **Insert at Beginning of Line**: A shortcut for \`^\` + \`i\`. Enters Insert mode at the first non-whitespace character of the line. Incredibly useful. |
| \`a\` | (append) | **Append After Cursor**: Enters Insert mode and places the cursor *after* the character it's currently on. |
| \`A\` | (Append) | **Append at End of Line**: A shortcut for \`$\` + \`a\`. Enters Insert mode at the very end of the current line. |
| \`o\` | (open) | **Open New Line Below**: Creates a new, empty line *below* the current line and enters Insert mode, ready for you to type. |
| \`O\` | (Open) | **Open New Line Above**: Creates a new, empty line *above* the current line and enters Insert mode. |
| \`R\` | (Replace) | **Enter Replace Mode**: Each character you type will overwrite an existing character, like the "Overwrite" mode in old word processors. |

#### Real-World Example
You're on a line of code: \`const name = "John"\`. You realize you forgot a semicolon. Instead of navigating to the end and then entering insert mode, you just press \`A\` from anywhere on the line, type \`;\`, and press \`Esc\`. Done in 3 keystrokes.

#### Tips & Common Pitfalls
- **Pitfall**: "Sticking" in Insert mode. New users often enter Insert mode and never leave. The Vim way is to enter, make your change, and immediately press \`Esc\` to return to Normal mode. Think of it as quick surgical strikes.
- **Tip**: Use the most specific command. Need to add a comment above the current line? Use \`O\` instead of \`k\` -> \`o\`. It saves keystrokes and mental energy.

#### Practice Exercises
1.  Place your cursor in the middle of a word. Press \`i\` and type something. Press \`Esc\`.
2.  Place your cursor in the middle of the same word. Press \`a\` and type something. Notice the difference.
3.  From anywhere on a line, press \`I\` and type \`// \` to comment it out.
4.  From anywhere on a line, press \`A\` to add text to the very end.

    title: 'âœ¨ 4. Editing Text (The "Verbs")',
    content: `
### In-Depth Explanation

In Vim, editing commands are like verbs in a language. You combine a verb (like \`d\` for delete) with a motion (like \`w\` for word). This "Vim grammar" is what makes it so powerful.

**Mode**: Normal Mode

| Command | Breakdown | Detailed Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| \`x\` | (x-out) | **Delete Character**: Deletes the character directly under the cursor. |
| \`dw\` | (delete word) | **Delete Word**: Deletes from the cursor to the beginning of the next word. A perfect example of Vim's verb+noun grammar! |
| \`dd\` | (delete line) | **Delete Whole Line**: Deletes the entire line the cursor is on. The double character (\`dd\`, \`yy\`, \`cc\`) often signifies a line-wise operation. |
| \`2dd\` | (2 delete line) | **Delete 2 Lines**: Combines a count (2) with a command (\`dd\`). This works for most Normal mode commands. |
| \`d$\` | (delete to end) | **Delete to End of Line**: Deletes from the cursor to the end of the line. |
| \`u\` | (undo) | **Undo**: Undoes the last change. You can press it multiple times. |
| \`Ctrl + r\` | (redo) | **Redo**: Reverses the last undo. |
| \`yy\` | (yank line) | **Copy (Yank) a Line**: "Yank" is Vim's term for copy. This copies the entire current line into a register (clipboard). |
| \`yw\` | (yank word) | **Copy (Yank) a Word**: Copies from the cursor to the start of the next word. |
| \`p\` | (paste) | **Paste After Cursor**: Pastes the copied content *after* the cursor's position. If you copied a whole line, it pastes on the line below. |
| \`P\` | (Paste) | **Paste Before Cursor**: Pastes the copied content *before* the cursor. If you copied a whole line, it pastes on the line above. |

#### Real-World Example
You have a line of code you want to move. You don't need to highlight it with a mouse, press Ctrl-C, move your cursor, and press Ctrl-V. In Vim, you just press \`dd\` to delete (and automatically copy) the line, move your cursor with \`j\` or \`k\`, and press \`p\` to paste it. It's incredibly fast.

#### Tips & Common Pitfalls
- **Pitfall**: Forgetting that \`dd\` also copies. When you delete a line with \`dd\`, it's automatically in your clipboard. You don't need to \`yy\` first. This lets you move lines very quickly.
- **Tip**: The "change" operator, \`c\`, is a powerful combination of "delete" and "insert". \`cw\` will **c**hange a **w**ord by deleting it and immediately putting you in Insert mode. \`cc\` will change a whole line. It's often more efficient than \`d\` followed by \`i\`.

#### Practice Exercises
1.  Use \`dd\` to delete a line. Move somewhere else and use \`p\` to paste it.
2.  Place your cursor on a word and type \`dw\`. Then press \`u\` to undo it.
3.  Yank a line with \`yy\` and paste it 5 times using \`5p\`.
4.  Place your cursor on a word and type \`cw\`. Type a new word and press \`Esc\`. Notice how it replaced the old word.

    id: 'search-replace',
    title: 'âœ¨ 5. Searching & Replacing',
    content: `
### In-Depth Explanation

Searching is a fundamental editing task. Vim provides powerful tools for finding text and for performing complex search-and-replace operations.

**Mode**: Enter from Normal Mode. Search-and-replace happens in Command-Line Mode.

| Command | Breakdown | Detailed Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| \`/word\` | (forward slash) | **Search Forward**: Press \`/\` in Normal mode. The cursor jumps to the command line. Type your search term and press Enter. Vim will jump to the first match *after* the cursor. |
| \`?word\` | (question mark) | **Search Backward**: Same as \`/\`, but searches *before* the cursor. |
| \`n\` | (next) | **Jump to Next Match**: After a search, press \`n\` to jump to the next occurrence in the same direction you were searching. |
| \`N\` | (Next, opposite) | **Jump to Previous Match**: Jumps to the next occurrence in the opposite direction. |
| \`:%s/old/new/g\` | (substitute) | **Search and Replace**: This is a Command-Line mode command. <br> **:** Enters Command-Line mode. <br> **%**: A range, meaning "every line in the file". <br> **s**: The substitute command. <br> **/old/**: The pattern to find. <br> **/new/**: The replacement text. <br> **/g**: A flag for "global," meaning replace *every* occurrence on a line, not just the first one. |
| \`:%s/old/new/gc\` | (substitute confirm) | **Replace with Confirmation**: The \`c\` flag at the end adds a confirmation step. For each match, Vim will pause and ask you to confirm the replacement (y/n/a/q). |

#### Real-World Example
You've misspelled a variable name, \`calculateTotal\`, as \`calculatTotal\` throughout a file. You don't need to hunt for each one. You simply run \`:%s/calculatTotal/calculateTotal/g\`. In one command, every instance is fixed.

#### Tips & Common Pitfalls
- **Pitfall**: Forgetting the \`g\` flag in substitute. If you run \`:%s/old/new/\`, it will only replace the *first* "old" on each line. The \`g\` flag is crucial for replacing all instances.
- **Tip**: To make searches case-insensitive, you can type \`\\c\` in your search pattern (e.g., \`/word\\c\`) or set it permanently with \`:set ignorecase\`.
- **Tip**: The search term you use with \`/\` is remembered. If you want to replace that term, you can leave the "find" part of the substitute command empty: \`:%s//new/g\`.

#### Practice Exercises
1.  Use \`/\` to search for a common word in your file. Use \`n\` and \`N\` to jump between matches.
2.  Use \`?\` to search for the same word backwards.
3.  Replace every instance of "the" with "THE" by running \`:%s/the/THE/g\`.
4.  Use the confirmation flag \`c\` to selectively replace a word. Try replacing some but not others.
