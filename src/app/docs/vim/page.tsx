# 📘 Vim Commands – Beginner Friendly Guide

Vim is a text editor used inside the terminal. At first, it feels confusing, but once you understand the modes and commands, it becomes very powerful.

---

## ✨ 1. Modes in Vim

Think of Vim modes like tools in a toolbox:

- **Normal Mode (default)** → move around and give commands.
- **Insert Mode** → type text like a regular editor.
- **Visual Mode** → highlight and select text.
- **Command-Line Mode** → run commands like save, quit, search.
- **Replace Mode** → type over existing text.

👉 Example: When you open Vim, you’re in **Normal Mode**. Press \`i\` to type, then press \`Esc\` to stop typing.

---

## ✨ 2. Moving Around (Navigation)

Use these keys like arrow keys:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| \`h\` | Move left |
| \`l\` | Move right |
| \`j\` | Move down |
| \`k\` | Move up |
| \`0\` | Jump to beginning of line |
| \`^\` | Jump to first word in line |
| \`$\` | Jump to end of line |
| \`w\` | Jump forward word by word |
| \`b\` | Jump backward word by word |
| \`gg\` | Go to top of file |
| \`G\` | Go to bottom of file |
| \`1G\` | Go to top of file (alternative) |

👉 Example: If your file is very long, \`gg\` takes you to the top and \`G\` takes you to the end.

| \`:%s/old/new/gc\` | Replace with confirmation | c - confirmation for each word

👉 Example: Type \`/error\` to find the word “error” in your file. Press \`n\` to go to the next match.

👉 Example: If your file has many “cat” words, \`:%s/cat/dog/g\` changes all cats into dogs.

## 🎯 Practice Scenario
1. Open Vim: \`vim notes.txt\`
2. Press \`i\` → type: \`Hello, this is my note.\`
3. Press \`Esc\` → type \`o\` → new line opens → type \`Another note.\`
4. Press \`Esc\` → type \`/note\` → finds the word “note.”
5. Type \`:%s/note/task/g\` → replaces “note” with “task.”
6. Press \`:wq\` → saves and quits.
